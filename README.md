# Bayesian Inference

## Prerequisites
A basic understanding of probability theory and statistics is required to comprehend the content of this repository.

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook providing an introduction to Bayesian inference. The goal is to offer a comprehensive understanding of the Bayesian methodology for making inferences on the probability distribution of an unknown parameter. 

Inspiration was drawn from a fantastic notebook available on GitHub: [Bayesian-Blogs](https://github.com/gabgilling/Bayesian-Blogs/blob/main/Blog%20Post%201%20final.ipynb). However, this repository expands on the original work by explicitly showcasing all the steps involved in the updating procedure. The emphasis is on facilitating visual understanding of the Bayesian methodology.

## Animated Videos
To aid in grasping the updating procedure, two animated videos have been created:

1. **1_bayesian_update**: Demonstrates how the one-step update works for different sample sizes.
2. **2_bayesian_update**: Illustrates how the dynamic update of the distribution of the parameter occurs as new information flows in.

The code to generate the MP4 animations is included in the Jupyter Notebook.

Feel free to explore the notebook and animations to enhance your understanding of Bayesian inference.
