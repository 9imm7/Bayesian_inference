# Bayesian_inference
Prerequisites to understand what has been done is the basic understanding of probability theory and statistics.
In the notebook you can find an introduction to bayesian inference, i tryed to be as explicit as possible, showing all the steps and the tehory behind the bayesian methodology for doing infrence on the probability distribution of an unknown parameter. I took inspiration form this brilliant notebook found on github https://github.com/gabgilling/Bayesian-Blogs/blob/main/Blog%20Post%201%20final.ipynb but i expanded and showed all the steps involved in the updating procedure in such a way to make possible to visually understand the methodology. In the spirit of showing how the updating procedure works i created 2 animated videos that display : 
-1_bayesian_update - how the one step update works for different sample size
-2_bayesian_update - how the dynamic update of the distribution of the parameter happens as new information flows in. 
Also the code to genearte the mp4 animations are in the notebook.
